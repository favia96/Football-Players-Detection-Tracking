## Football Players Detection and  Tracking
# Federico Favia - BSc Thesis in Information and Communications Engineering, University of Trento, October 2018

Convolutional Neural Networks' use for detection and tracking of players in sports events" ("Impiego di reti neurali convoluzionali per il rilevamento e tracciamento di giocatori in contesto sportivo"), developed within the student internship at (Xtensa Srl)[https://xtensa.it/].
- Use and modification of YoloV3, state-of-the-art real-time object detection neural network, to recognize players in football games videos (see the folder yolo_modifications). 
- Then software development of tracker for the same players through C++ and OpenCV library (see tirocinio.cpp) and evaluation of tracking's consistency through Matlab (see graphs.m). 
- Finally, comparison of this approach with respect to classical algorithms, such as Mean shift.
